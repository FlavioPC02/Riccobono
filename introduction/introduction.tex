\subsection{Purpose}
In recent years, cyclists have increasingly felt the need to travel safely within urban and suburban road networks. However, updated and reliable information on the actual conditions of cycle paths, their quality, potential obstacles, and the direct experiences of other cyclists is often lacking.\\
To address this need, a cyclists' association decided to develop Best Bike Paths (BBP): a system designed to increase safety and awareness among the cycling community.\\
The aim of the product is to allow users to choose the best route based on shared and verifiable data, benefiting not only from their own records but also from information collected by other cyclists.\\
BBP therefore intends to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Promote safer and more reliable route choices by sharing community experiences and assessments;
    \item Support users on their itineraries by providing useful data such as total distance, average speed, and other relevant statistics;
    \item Automatically enrich trip information with data from external services, such as weather conditions, temperature, or wind;
    \item Contribute to the creation of a constantly updated inventory of cycling routes based on distributed contributions.
\end{itemize}
The fundamental motivation for the existence of BBP is therefore to improve the safety, quality of the experience and the autonomy of cyclists by offering a collaborative, informed and continuously updated tool.
