\subsection{Purpose}
In recent years, cyclists have increasingly felt the need to travel safely within urban and suburban road networks. However, updated and reliable information on the actual conditions of cycle paths, their quality, potential obstacles, and the direct experiences of other cyclists is often lacking.\\
To address this need, a cyclists' association decided to develop Best Bike Paths (BBP): a system designed to increase safety and awareness among the cycling community.\\
\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item G1 - Cyclists can become aware of their cycling activities;
    \item G2 - Relevant information about bike paths is shared by cyclists with the community;
    \item G3 - Cyclists can choose routes suited to their needs;
    \item G4 - I ciclisti hanno accesso a informazioni affidabili sulle condizioni attuali dei percorsi;
    \item G5 - Cyclists can rely on consistent and consolidated informations.
\end{itemize}
The purpose of the Best Bike Paths (BBP) system is to address cyclists' growing need for safe and informed travel by providing reliable, trustworthy, and shared information on cycling routes.\\
The product allows users to choose the best route based on shared and verifiable data, benefiting not only from their own recordings but also from information collected by other cyclists.\\
The fundamental rationale for BBP's existence is therefore to improve cyclists' safety, quality of experience, and autonomy by offering a collaborative, informed, and continuously updated tool.ve, informed and continuously updated tool.
