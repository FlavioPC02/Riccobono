\subsection{Purpose}

In recent years, cyclists have increasingly felt the need to travel safely within urban and suburban road networks. However, updated and reliable information on the actual conditions of cycle paths, their quality, potential obstacles, and the direct experiences of other cyclists is often lacking.

To address this need, a cyclists' association decided to develop Best Bike Paths (BBP), a system designed to increase safety and awareness within the cycling community.

\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item G1 — Cyclists have an accurate awareness of their cycling activities;
    \item G2 — Relevant information about bike paths is shared by cyclists with the community;
    \item G3 — Cyclists can choose routes suited to their safety and efficiency needs;
    \item G4 — Cyclists have access to reliable and up-to-date information on the current state of bike paths;
    \item G5 — Information available to cyclists is consistent, consolidated, and trustworthy.
\end{itemize}

The purpose of the Best Bike Paths (BBP) system is to support cyclists in making safe and informed decisions by providing reliable, shared, and verifiable information on bike routes. The system enables users to choose the best route based not only on their personal recordings but also on information contributed by other cyclists.

The fundamental rationale for BBP's existence is therefore to improve cyclists' safety, quality of experience, and autonomy by offering a collaborative, informed, and continuously updated tool.
